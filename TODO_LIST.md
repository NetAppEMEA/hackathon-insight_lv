# Hackathon-vol1 To Do list

The following is a list of changes and improvements which need to be implemented.

1. Update camera-webservice to use Sully's suggested changes.
  1. Use PiCamera module instead of making a system call to fswebcam.
  2. Add additional targets for allowing camera testing.
  3. Pull in his code from https://git.corp.netapp.com/asulliva/hacknight

2. Add GitHub Flow module
Add a section in the training to have users clone, branch, code, commit, then generate a GitHub pull-request.  Also have users review the pull-requests.  

3. Add Jenkins/GitHub module
Like the GitHub Flow module, add a flow which further demonstrates how developers work collaboratively together using tools like Git and flows like Jenkins.  

4. Look for NetApp specific SE learning
Ideally the hack-night will increase SE's knowledge of Development, DevOps and 3rd Platform.  Brainstorm content for additional modules.

5. Finish updating the top level README.md file.  Consider merging hack-night-instruction.md content into a single document.

6. Create hack-night presentation for the introduction.  

7. ~~Create Getting started email~~ **DONE**
