# Hack-night - Suggested Pre-work

If you are a beginner or some of these topics are new to you, then you should take some time prior to the Hack-night event to prepare yourself.

Scan thru these topics - skip topics you already know and spend time on the topics you might need additional help with.

## UNIX Terminal
The RaspberryPI will be accessed using SSH which is typically run from a UNIX command line.  On a Mac, you can simply open a 'Terminal' window which provides you with a UNIX command line.  From there you can type 'ssh pi@<ip address>' to access your RaspberryPI.
On a PC, you will need to install a tool like PuTTy (Google "putty download windows")
For instructions on how to use PuTTY with the RaspberryPI Youtube.com "how to ssh with putty raspberry pi".

## Git/GitHub Tutorial
If this is your first time using Git or GitHub (or any source control tool for that matter), I recommend watching a Git/GitHub tutorial.  There are many good videos on Youtube.com, here is one example; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fKg7e37bQE
